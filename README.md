# S-DEIM
First, download all files in this folder. The main code to run is input_RBC.m. It loads three data sets: RBC_POD.mat, RBC_train.mat, and RBC_test.mat. These data sets correspond to a direct numerical simulation of the Rayleigh-Benard convection. 

This repository contains the data and code for reproducing the results of the following manuscript: "State Estimation Using Sparse DEIM and Recurrent Neural Networks" by M. Farazmand. This paper must be appropriately cited if the data and/or code is used.
