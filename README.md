This repository contains the code for reproducing the results (third example) of the following manuscript: "State Estimation Using Sparse DEIM and Recurrent Neural Networks" by M. Farazmand. This paper must be appropriately cited if the data and/or code is used.

First, download all files in this folder. The main code to run is input_RBC.m. It loads three data sets: RBC_POD.mat, RBC_train.mat, and RBC_test.mat. These data sets correspond to a direct numerical simulation of the Rayleigh-Benard convection. 


Datasets:
To run the codes, you will need to download the following datasets from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15832022
RBC_POD.mat, RBC_train.mat, and RBC_test.mat
